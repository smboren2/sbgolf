<p>There are various approaches to modeling events and every predictive model will have its strengths and weaknesses. I've recognized that the current iteration of my model has some major weaknesses, but I've also found that it is profitable in single round head-to-head matchups when backtesting. From a wagering perspective, that is really all we care about; consistently profiting. While I intend to refine the model that produces the +EV plays for each round, I also plan on moving forward with this iteration for wagering purposes.</p>
<p>For transparency, I will provide all of the wagers and outcomes for anything greater than 5% positive expected value and the results will be against the closing number at Draftkings Sportsbook.</p>
<p>If you look through the results, you'll notice some bias in the model. It tends to bet on/against certain individuals which is something you should keep in mind week over week if you are using my +EV matchups to make a wager.</p>
